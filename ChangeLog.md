**Changes since 0.1.0.0**

  [#4928](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/4928).

Other changes:

* Rename `pantry-tmp` package back to `pantry`, now that we have gained
  maintainership (which had been used by someone else for a candidate-only test
  that made it look like the name was free but prevented uploading a real
  package).

* Initial release
